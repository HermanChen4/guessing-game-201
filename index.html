            <p> Hi welcome to my page, my name is Herman. I am a sophmore in college, who is currently majoring in biology.
                I started code fellows to begin a new career, and switch over from biology. I do not have any job experience 
                other than some fast food jobs such as chipotle and starbucks and being an office administrator for my church.
                Some goals I had in mind is to program my own game, and just to become more confident in my coding skills overall. 
                My dream job would be to either work at a FAANG company or Nvidia. 
            </p>
